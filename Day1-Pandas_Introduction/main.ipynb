    "## Setting-up Pandas\n",
    "With your VSCode already configured with your preferred version of Python, follow the theps below to set-up Pandas library.\n",
    "1. Open your terminal and write the following command to install Pandas (if you prefer you can use a virtual environment as well, so you won't have to install the modules in your global environment). This will install the latets dependencies and packages\n",
    "`python3`: To start the python environment\n",
    "`pip install pandas`: To install pandas\n",
    "2. To check if Pandas was successfully installed, run the following commands:\n",
    "`python3`: To start the python environment\n",
    "`import pandas as pd`: To import pandas under the alias pd\n",
    "`pd.__version__`: To check the version. If you see something like `'2.2.3'`, then we're good.\n",
    "3. Install the `Jupyter` notebook extension in VSCode\n",
    "4. Setup the kernel to be used by locating the python folder and setting it as your interpreter\n",
    "5. Voila! we're all set!"

    "## What is Pandas?\n",
    "Pandas is a Python library used for working with data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The name \"Pandas\" has a reference to both \"Panel Data\", and \"Python Data Analysis\" and was created by Wes McKinney in 2008.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use Pandas?\n",
    "Pandas allows us to analyze big data and make conclusions based on statistical theories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas can clean messy data sets, and make them readable and relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relevant data is very important in data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Can Pandas Do?\n",
    "Pandas gives you answers about the data. Like:\n",
    "\n",
    "Is there a correlation between two or more columns?\n",
    "What is average value?\n",
    "Max value?\n",
    "Min value?\n",
    "Pandas are also able to delete rows that are not relevant, or contains wrong values, like empty or NULL values. This is called cleaning the data."
